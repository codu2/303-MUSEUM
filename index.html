                                    <p class="p">Manet was the elder statesman of the Impressionists, although he never participated in their exhibitions but continued to compete in the Salons. His unconventional subject matter drawn from modern life, and his concern for the artist's freedom in handling paint made him an important precursor of Impressionism.</p>

                                    <h1>The Monet Family in Their Garden at Argenteuil(1874)</h1>
                                    <p class="p">Manet was a native Parisian and the son of wealthy parents. He trained with Thomas Couture. His work was founded on the opposition of light and shadow, a restricted palette in which black was very important, and on painting directly from the model. The work of the Spaniard Velázquez directly influenced his adoption of this style.</p>

                                    <h1>A Bar at the Folies-Bergère(1882)</h1>
                                    <p class="p">In Paris he associated with avant-garde writers, notably Baudelaire, who appears in 'The Music in the Tuileries Gardens'. Manet's work became famous at the Salon des Refusés, the exhibition of paintings rejected by the official Salon. In 1863 and 1867 he held one-man exhibitions. In the 1870s, under the influence of Monet and Renoir, he produced landscapes and street scenes directly inspired by Impressionism. He remained reluctant to exhibit with the Impressionists, and sought the approval of the Salon all his life.</p>

                            <h6>Manet or Monet:</h6>
                            <p>Édouard Manet and Claude Monet are two of the best-known French artists of the 19th century. Their names are easily recognizable, but also easily confused. A simple slipup between vowels can turn an impressive art-world anecdote into a chaotic and confusing mess.</p>
                            <p>The Manet-and-Monet confusion goes all the way back to 1865, when both artists were included in the same Salon. The Salon was a major exhibition held once a year in Paris, where artists would show their best two artworks to be judged by art critics and the public.</p>
                            <p>The 1865 Salon exhibition was hung in alphabetical order. The two painters’ artworks were placed next to each other, and more than a century’s worth of confusion followed. That year Monet exhibited two landscapes, which were generally received positively.</p>
                            <div class="story-sub-img">

                            </div>
                            <p>Next to Monet, however, hung Manet’s now-infamous Olympia, which depicted a contemporary prostitute, a West Indian maid, and a black cat hissing with its back arched and tail up. The painting instantly caused a scandal, helped launch modern art as we know it, and to this day is among Manet’s most recognizable artworks.</p>
                            <p>The proximity of the two artists’ paintings and their similar names led to some confusion, which resulted in Manet being accidentally complimented on Monet’s sea and landscape paintings. A friendly competitiveness was sparked between the two artists that continued throughout both of their careers.</p>

                            <h6>About Impressionism:</h6>
                            <p>Impressionism is an art movement from the late 19th century that took some of Manet’s ideas to another level. Artists were interested in capturing fleeting moments of modern life quickly. This led to many artists taking their canvases outside of the studio to capture dancers, cafe scenes, sunrises, and sunsets. Today, Impressionism has made such an impact that we see its influence in art and visual culture to the point that we may not even notice it—but this work was radically different and game-changing in 19th-century Paris.</p>
                            <div class="story-sub-img">
                                <img src="img/monet-manet1.jpeg" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <p>Despite being a major influence on the movement, Manet was not an Impressionist. His work is always in dialog with art history, with tradition, with art of the museum, says curator Scott Allan. He adds, “modernity and tradition are always in confrontation. That’s where a lot of the tension in Manet’s art comes from.”</p>
                            <div class="story-sub-img">
                                <img src="img/monet5.jpeg" alt="">
                            </div>
                            <p>Monet, on the other hand, is a true Impressionist. In fact, the term comes from a Monet painting titled Impression, Sunrise. The group called the Impressionists also included Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Paul Cézanne. They frequently exhibited their paintings together. Regardless of influence, Manet never exhibited with Monet and this group of Impressionists, and he is technically not an Impressionist.</p>

                            <p>The Grand Channel is not the only plot which would make you think who is who. Once both artists looked out their windows. Monet was impressed with the colours and he painted a red - white - blue holiday. Manet got used to notice people on streets and he saw a bit different picture, a one - legged soldier who didn't let France forget about their shame war 7 years ago.</p>
